/**
 * Wake executor — single-process scheduler that drives `loop_defer` wakes.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Exactly ONE process runs the executor per deployment. Race safety
 *     across ticks is provided by `loopWakeRepo.claimDue` (FOR UPDATE SKIP
 *     LOCKED). Mission-run wake resumes also claim the run row with a CAS
 *     before injecting the wake banner, so `/retry` and wake cannot both
 *     resume the same stale `paused_wake` snapshot.
 *   - The desktop-agent host should start one process-local executor with
 *     hardcoded defaults (interval=2000ms, batchSize=10) after DB bootstrap.
 *     Wake is an installed-runtime concern, not a renderer concern.
 *
 * Tick semantics:
 *   1. `claimDue(now, batchSize)` — atomically flips the pending rows to
 *      `consumed` and returns them. Rows the executor cannot handle (e.g.
 *      session status drifted to `running` because a user preempted) are
 *      SKIPPED but NOT unclaimed — the row is terminal once consumed, and
 *      the race is accepted (the user already resumed the session, so no
 *      banner needs to be injected).
 *   2. For every claimed row, the executor re-checks the mission run state
 *      and either (a) injects a `wake_due` banner + triggers the resume
 *      path or (b) logs the drift and skips. Every outcome is reported on
 *      the returned `ClaimedWake` so tests and operators can see the result.
 *
 * Post-M12 simplification: `full_autonomous` mode is gone. Every wake row
 * targets a mission run; the executor no longer branches on `wake.kind`.
 *
 * Structural split: this file is the compatibility façade + lifecycle owner.
 * The tick implementation lives under `./executor/`:
 *
 *   deps.ts       — `WakeDeps` + production default deps wiring.
 *   tick.ts       — `tick` + `ClaimedWake` / `ClaimedWakeOutcome`.
 *   claimed.ts    — normal claimed-job handling (`handleClaimed`).
 *   auto-retry.ts — auto-retry handling (`handleAutoRetryClaimed`).
 *   provider.ts   — `isWakeProviderConfigured`.
 *
 * `startWakeExecutor` + `WakeExecutorHandle` + `StartOptions` stay here as the
 * self-scheduling lifecycle owner so the setTimeout chain, in-flight drain, and
 * stop() teardown remain in one place.
